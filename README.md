## Overview
This project aims to provide pool players with shot recommendations and accurately predict the outcome of a shot in real time. An intel D435 RGBD camera is used to ascertain the state of the table. This information is then transferred to a users mobile and displayed using mixed reality. For further details please refer to 'Use_of_Mixed_Reality_to_Accurately_Model_Billiard_Shots_Given_a_Table_State.pdf'.
